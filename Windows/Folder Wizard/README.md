# Folder Series Generator

A simple Python utility that creates a numbered series of folders in any location you choose — fast, clean, and perfect for organizing projects, batches, or datasets.

Includes a slick ASCII banner and smart defaults to keep things smooth.


# Features

* Creates multiple folders in a numbered sequence.

* Custom base name (Project-1, Project-2, etc.).

* Choose any folder location.

* Special shortcut to use the script’s own directory.

* Skips folders that already exist.
 
* Clean terminal output with status messages.

* Uses only Python standard libraries.


# Requirements

* Python 3.6

* Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

No external dependencies required.


# Example Output
```bash
Creating folders in: C:\MyFolders

Created: Project-1
Created: Project-2
Skipped (already exists): Project-3
Created: Project-4
Created: Project-5
```
