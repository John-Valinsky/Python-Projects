# Python Socket HTTP Client

A simple Python socket-based HTTP client that demonstrates how to manually send an HTTP request and receive a response from a web server using low-level networking.

This project connects to google.com over port 80, sends a raw HTTP GET request, and prints the server’s response.


# About the Project

This script helps you understand:

* How TCP sockets work in Python

* How HTTP requests look at the raw protocol level.

* Client–server communication without external libraries.

* Basics of networking useful for cybersecurity & forensics.

No frameworks. No abstractions. Just pure sockets.


# How It Works

* Creates a TCP socket.
